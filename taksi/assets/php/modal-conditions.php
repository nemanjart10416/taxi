                        Airport transfer provides services based on the following terms and conditions, the service descriptions and the price lists. Deviating terms and conditions do not apply, even if they are not expressly contradicted. Deviations from these conditions require the express written approval of Flughafentransfer. A contract is only concluded if this is confirmed by airport transfer.

                    <p class="text-justify text-shadow-2 mb-4">
                        The scope of services is determined exclusively according to the written order confirmation from Flughafentransfer or subsidiary to the written offer from Flughafentransfer. Information contained in brochures, service catalogues, price lists and similar information is only binding insofar as express reference is made to it. The transport takes place according to the regulations of the Road Traffic Act and the PbefG. The passengers have to follow the instructions of the airport transfer or the chauffeur. If guests act against the instructions, or if they represent a hazard according to the StVO, or the safety of road traffic through impairments of the chauffeur, Flughafentransfer is entitled to exclude them from the carriage.

                    <h2>Airport pickup (airport transfer)</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify text-shadow-2 mb-4">
                        Airport Transfer must be informed immediately of any change in the agreed pick-up time, for whatever reason. Any damage caused by failure to notify without delay shall be borne by the customer. The airport transfer chauffeur will be available at the agreed pick-up time at the respective meeting point in the airport terminal or at the meeting point previously agreed in writing, with a name tag or company logo (earlier or later availability must be specified when booking) and will wait up to 60 minutes at no extra charge. A telephone number at which the passenger can reach his chauffeur is given in the confirmation letter. If no contact has been made with the passenger or the customer after the 60-minute waiting period, the chauffeur will return to Vienna without a passenger. The airport transfer service is then deemed to have been rendered and the full fare is due for payment. Additional waiting times requested by the customer will be calculated according to the valid price list. Prices The prices include the statutory sales tax at the respective statutory rate. The prices valid on the day of the booking confirmation apply. All-inclusive prices not listed in the price list can only be agreed in writing and are only valid for the agreed travel date and rental period. Additional times and distances are calculated according to the valid price list. Additional costs due to delays are at the expense of the customer, unless the delays are due to the fault of the airport transfer or the chauffeur. The fare includes passenger transport with normal luggage;</p>
                    <p class="h2">Payment Terms</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-shadow-2 mb-4">
                        Airport transfer reserves the right to charge a deposit of up to 50% of the total price before the start of the journey or to request a blank debit voucher from a valid credit card issued for airport transfer before accepting an order. Remaining payments are due for payment within the periods stated on the invoice. The timeliness of the payment depends on the receipt of the amount for the unconditional disposal of airport transfer. In the case of payment by check, the claim is only deemed to have been paid after it has been fully credited. Payments are always used to settle the oldest claim. If the customer is in default of payment, Flughafentransfer charges interest of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate, subject to the assertion of further default damages. A reminder fee of €10 will be charged for the second and each subsequent reminder. The customer reserves the right to prove that the damage was less.

                    <p class="h2">Cancellations and Withdrawal</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-shadow-2 mb-4">
                        Cancellations are only effective if they are made in writing or confirmed in writing in the event of an oral declaration by Airport Transfer. The timeliness of written cancellations depends on the access to the airport transfer. Cancellations up to and including 24 hours before the contractually agreed start of the journey are free of charge. In the case of cancellations, Flughafentransfer calculates a percentage of the basic fare as compensation. This proportion is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>50% for cancellations up to 12 hours</li>
                        <li>80% for cancellations up to 3 hours before the contractually agreed start of performance
                        </li>
                        <li>100% for later cancellations and no-show.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify text-shadow-2 mb-4">
                        Airport transfer calculates expenses regardless of the timeliness of the cancellations if they have already occurred. The customer is expressly permitted to prove that the airport transfer has suffered no damage or a lower damage. Flughafentransfer reserves the right to withdraw from the contract in whole or in part if the customer stops paying, becomes insolvent or, due to external circumstances, it can be assumed that the services will be misused, or the customer violates his/her contractual obligations.
